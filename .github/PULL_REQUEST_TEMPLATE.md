Having trouble with the PR checker? Here are some common issues and resolutions:

- verify_formatting is failing
  - run `yarn format path/to/markdown/file.md` or `yarn format:all` and commit the results
- verify_lint is failing
  - same as above
  - if verify_lint is still failing, running `yarn lint` locally should let you know what needs to be changed by hand
- test is failing
  - ensure any new markdown files have a `Title` and `Description` defined in their metadata
  - ensure any new markdown files only contain alphanumerics and dashes in their file names and have the same name as their parent directory
  - if that looks ok, running `yarn test` locally should let you know what the issue is
