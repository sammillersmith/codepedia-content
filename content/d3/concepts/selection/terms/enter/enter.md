The **`.enter()`** selection method refers to a subset of the selection that represents placeholders for elements to be added to the document. This selection is commonly used in conjunction with `.data()` binding method when there are more data elements than corresponding DOM elements.

## Syntax

```pseudo
d3.selection.enter()
```

- `selection`: It contains placeholders for new elements that need to be added to the DOM to match the available data.

> **Note:** The `.enter()` method doesn't take any arguments.

## Example

The following example illustrates the use of the `.enter()` method. Here, it returns an enter selection as the number of `data` elements is more than the `div` elements selected:

```js
const data = ['🎄', '🎅', '❄️', '❤️', '🎁'];
const divSelection = d3.select('body').selectAll('div').data(data);
const enterSelection = divSelection
  .enter()
  .append('div')
  .text((d) => d);
```

Following is the output of the above code:
