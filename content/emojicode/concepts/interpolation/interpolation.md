Title: '🧲 Interpolation'
Description: 'String interpolation can be used to construct a string from a mix of constants, variables, and others by including their values inside a string literal. In Emojicode, to insert a value into a string using string interpolation, we can write the variable inside two 🧲s and it will print its value. Suppose we have a constant named height with a value of 3000, and we want to use string interpolation to print out a fun fact: shell 3000 ➡️ height 😀 🔤Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan, which is 🧲height🧲 feet, without a rope!🔤❗️ '

String interpolation can be used to construct a string from a mix of constants, variables, and others by including their values inside a string literal.

In Emojicode, to insert a value into a string using string interpolation, we can write the variable inside two `🧲`s and it will print its value.

Suppose we have a constant named `height` with a value of `3000`, and we want to use string interpolation to print out a fun fact:

```shell
3000 ➡️ height

😀 🔤Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan, which is 🧲height🧲 feet, without a rope!🔤❗️
```

It will output:

```shell
Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan, which is 3000 feet, without a rope!
```

## Example

```shell
💭 Tip Calculator

🏁 🍇
  3.80 ➡️ tip

  😀 🔤The tip is $🧲tip🧲🔤❗️
🍉
```

It will output:

```shell
The tip is 3.80
```
