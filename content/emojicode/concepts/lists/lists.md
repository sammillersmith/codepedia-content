Title: '🍿 Lists'
Description: 'A list literal is a listing of expressions. Lists are always ordered and can contain different types of objects, such as strings, integers, booleans, etc. Lists are a mutable data type and therefore a good choice for dynamic data (adding and subtracting to lists). In Emojicode, a list is created by using 🍿 and 🍆. For instance, the example below is a list literal with integer values 18, 67, 420. emojic 🍿 18 67 420 🍆 '

A list literal is a listing of expressions.

Lists are always ordered and can contain different types of objects, such as strings, integers, booleans, etc. Lists are a mutable data type and therefore a good choice for dynamic data (adding and subtracting to lists).

## Syntax

In Emojicode, a list is created by using 🍿 and 🍆.

For instance, the example below is a list literal with integer values `18`, `67`, `420`.

```emojic
🍿 18 67 420 🍆
```

Here's another list with three strings:

```emojic
🍿 🔤eggs🔤 🔤blueberries🔤 🔤cookies🔤 🍆
```

The compiler will try to infer the type of a list literal. The default type of list literals, is the list type 🍨, an ordered mutable collections of values.
