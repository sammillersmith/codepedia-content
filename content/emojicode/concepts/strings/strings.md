Title: '🔡 Strings'
Description: 'Strings are words or pieces of text that the computer treats as a single item. They provide a way to store something like a word, sentence, or whole paragraph. Technically speaking, a string is a sequence of characters. It can be of any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces as long as they are surrounded by 🔤s. Here are four different strings in Emojicode: shell 🔤This is a string!🔤 🔤This is also a string!!!🔤 🔤1337🔤'

Strings are words or pieces of text that the computer treats as a single item. They provide a way to store something like a word, sentence, or whole paragraph.

Technically speaking, a string is a sequence of characters. It can be of any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces as long as they are surrounded by `🔤`'s.

## Syntax

Here are four different strings in Emojicode:

```shell
🔤This is a string!🔤
🔤This is also a string!!!🔤
🔤1337🔤
🔤👆👍🔤
```

It’s important to distinguish between strings and the rest of the code in our programs. Every part of a program is made up of characters, but strings are the parts we intend to keep as data—not as instructions to be executed by the computer.

## Example

Here's a full program that print out two strings:

```shell
🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤2020...🔤❗️
  😀 🔤That was a crazy year.🔤❗️
🍉
```

## String Interpolation

String interpolation can be used to construct a string from a mix of constants, variables, and others by including their values inside a string literal.

In Emojicode, to insert a value into a string using string interpolation, we can write the variable inside two `🧲`s and it will print its value.

Suppose we have a constant named `height` with a value of `3000`, and we want to use string interpolation to print out a fun fact:

```shell
3000 ➡️ height

😀 🔤Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan, which is 🧲height🧲 feet, without a rope!🔤❗️
```

It will output:

```shell
Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan, which is 3000 feet, without a rope!
```
