We write Emojicode programs in files with the extension **.emojic** or **.🍇**.

Almost all the code in an Emojicode program will live inside a `🏁` block. A block is a collection of code. The `🏁` block indicates all the code that should run when the file is executed.

Within our larger program, we can indicate one or more blocks of code with `🍇` `🍉` code blocks:

- `🍇` to indicate the start of the code block
- `🍉` to indicate the end of the code block

So a basic Emojicode file will have the following structure:

```pseudo
🏁 🍇
  Some code go here
🍉
```

To print in Emojicode, we use the `😀` `❗️` method:

```shell
😀 🔤Hello, World!🔤❗️
```

This prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

- `🔤Hello, World!🔤` is a string. It holds the message we want to print to the terminal.
- We wrap the thing we want to print with a `😀` at the start and a `❗️` at the end.

## Example

Here's a program called **welcome.emojic** that prints a string:

```shell
🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤Welcome to Codecademy Docs🔤❗️
🍉
```
