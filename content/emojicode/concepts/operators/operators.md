## Arithmetic Operations

Emojicode supports arithmetic operators for:

- `➕`: addition
- `➖`: subtraction
- `✖️`: multiplication
- `➗`: division
- `🚮`: modulo (divides and gives the remainder)

For example:

```shell
4 ➕ 2 ➡️ score1     💭 scores1 is 6

4 ➖ 2 ➡️ score2     💭 scores2 is 2

4 ✖️ 2 ➡️ score3      💭 scores3 is 8

4 ➗ 2 ➡️ score4     💭 scores4 is 2

4 🚮 2 ➡️ score5     💭 scores5 is 0
```
