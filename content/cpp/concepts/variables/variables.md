A **variable** refers to a storage location in the computer’s memory that one can set aside to save, retrieve, and manipulate data.

## Declare a Variable

To create a variable, the type must be specified and a value must be assigned to it:

```pseudo
type name = value;
```

So to create a variable called `score` of type `int` and assign it the value 0:

```cpp
int score = 0;
```

## Display Variables

The `std::cout` object is used together with the `<<` operator to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the `<<` operator:

```cpp
int myAge = 30;

std::cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old.";
```

The output would be:

```shell
I am 30 years old.
```

## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  double tip = 3.85;
  std::cout << "Tip is" << tip;
}
```
