C++ has many functions that allows mathematical tasks to be performed on numbers.

Header `<cmath>` declares a set of functions to compute common mathematical operations and transformations:

```cpp
// Include the cmath library
#include <cmath>

std::cout << sqrt(64);    // Return the square root of 64
std::cout << log(2);      // Return the log of 2
std::cout << round(2.6);  // Round 2.6
```

A list of other popular math functions from the `<cmath>` library can be found in the table below:
