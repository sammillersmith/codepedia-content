**Strings** are objects that represent sequences of characters. In C++, the two ways to create strings are with the `string` class or with [C-style](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c/strings) character strings.

## String Class

The standard `string` class provides support for strings in C++.

```cpp
std::string welcome = "Hi";
std::string user_name = "@sonny";
std::string message = "Good nite! ðŸ˜‡";
```

## C-Style Character Strings

The C-style character string originated from the C language and continues to be supported within C++.

In C, the string is actually an array of characters, followed by a `null` character `'\0'`.

```cpp
char message[] = "Howdy";
```

So here's the memory presentation:

```shell
Character |   'H'    'o'    'w'    'd'    'y'   '\0'
Index     |    0      1      2      3      4      5
Address   |  23451  23452  23453  23454  23455  23456
```
