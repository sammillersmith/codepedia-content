**C++** is a very powerful programming language for performance-critical applications that rely on speed and efficient memory management. It’s used in a wide range of industries including software and game development, robotics, microcontrollers, VR/AR, and scientific computing.

The C++ language was created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/bjarne-stroustrup) at Bell Laboratories in 1979. As the name implies, C++ was derived from the [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) language; Bjarne’s goal was to add [object-oriented programming](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/object-oriented-programming) into C, a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality.

There are many of versions of the C++ programming language. These versions of the language are implementations of compilers based on specifications constructed by the ISO C++ community, the community that oversees the development of the language. The following are versions of the language:

->C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) is the first edition.
->C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003) is the second edition.
->C++11 is the third edition.
->C++14 is the fourth edition.
->C++17 is the fifth edition.

These versions have many differences, mainly additions to the standard library and expansion of APIs. These standards also have differences in APIs due to depreciation.
