**ACID properties** refer to properties a database [transaction](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/transaction) must follow in order to maintain consistency in a database. Those properties are as follows:

- Atomicity: The entire transaction must occur, or none of it does. There are no partial transactions.
- Consistency: The database must remain consistent before and after the transaction.
- Isolation: Transactions are independent of one another, and do not interfere with each other.
- Durability: A transaction, once completed, is permanent and persists even if a system failure occurs.
