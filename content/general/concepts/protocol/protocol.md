A **protocol** describes the rules, syntax, and semantics used by two or more devices in a computer network to connect and communicate with each other.

## The Internet

The most prominent computer network is the internet, which uses a collection of protocols known as the Internet Protocol Suite. This collection uses multiple layers to describe how data should be packetized, addressed, [routed](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/routing), and received between members of the network.

## Common Protocols

Some notable network protocols include the following:

|                                           Protocol                                           | Description                                                                                            |

| [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) | Used for fetching HTML documents and other web-based resources.                                        |
|                                    Internet Protocol (IP)                                    | Routes and addresses data packets for sending between networks.                                        |
|                             Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)                              | Facilitates client-server communication of network data.                                               |
|                                 User Datagram Protocol (UDP)                                 | Disregards error checks/corrections in favor of time-sensitive tasks (gaming, video conferences, etc.) |
