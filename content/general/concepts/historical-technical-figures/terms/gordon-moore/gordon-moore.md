**Gordon Moore** is the co-founder of Intel Corporation, the largest manufacturer of various computer parts like microprocessors for companies like Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. He was also the primary advocate for Moore's Law.

## Moore's Law

In 1965, Gordon Moore, then-CEO of Intel, predicted that twice as many transistors would be able to fit onto a computer chip every two years. This idea has served as a guiding principle and goal for the semiconductor industry to make sure that progress is being made consistently toward greater computing power in devices. Today, this is known as Moore's Law.

Being more of an economic law than one based on physics, there are limitations to Moore's Law. Computer chips can only get so small before reaching the atomic barrier. While Moore's Law has guided most of the technology industry for over 50 years, it perhaps will not hold true. Nonetheless, it proved to be a driving force in the world of computing.
