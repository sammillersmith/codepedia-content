**Sir Tim Berners-Lee** is an English computer scientist popularly known for his development of the World Wide Web in 1989.

While working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the European Particle Physics Laboratory, Berners-Lee saw the need for a system that would share information amongst researchers globally. With this motivation, Tim Berners-Lee facilitated the first transmission between an HTTP client and server. Berners-Lee then developed the first web browser in 1990. With these milestones met, Berners-Lee developed the first-ever website, [info.cern.ch](info.cern.ch).

In 1993, Berners-Lee wrote the very first version of [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html) (HyperText Markup Language), the standard markup language for web pages.

Tim Berners-Lee has since been a prominent figure in the further development of the World Wide Web, standing as the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and co-founder and CTO of Inrupt. Tim's goal as he states is to continue working toward net neutrality, privacy protection, and the inclusion of the Web.

**Fun fact:** A conference room was named after Tim Berners-Lee in Codecademy's old office.
