[**Bjarne Stroustrup**](https://www.stroustrup.com) (1950 - ) is a Danish computer scientist and principal designer of [C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp), an extension of the [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) programming language.

Stroustrup has authored several computer programming books focused on C++, including "The C++ Programming Language", and is currently a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.

As the principal designer of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup's goal was to add object-oriented programming into C, a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality, and to do so efficiently. Stroustrup's continued work in maintaining C++ is associated with improvements in performance and efficiency for a great number of applications including AI/ML, RDBMS, video games, financial systems, and graphics.

Dr. Stroustrup played a key role in the development of Codecademy's [Learn C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) course. Here's an insightful interview called [Talking C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/bjarne-stroustrup-interview/) that took part in the last segment of the production.
