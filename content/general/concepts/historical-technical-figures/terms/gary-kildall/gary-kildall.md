**Gary Kildall** (1942 - 1994) was an American computer scientist, entrepreneur, and technology educator. Among his contributions, he is best known for the development of **PL/M**, the first high-level programming language for microprocessors, and **CP/M**, an industry-standard operating system for early personal computers.

## Education

Kildall earned a B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Washington. Kildall's [Ph.D. thesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/906224) founded **data-flow analysis**, an approach to using compilers to optimize code.

## Technical Innovations

- _PL/M_: A high-level programming language for microprocessors. Kildall developed PL/M for Intel in 1973 and it was used in Intel microprocessors throughout the '70s and '80s. PL/M is widely recognized as the first high-level programming language and compiler for microprocessors.
- _CP/M_: An operating system for microprocessors. The invention of CP/M enabled microprocessors to communicate with disk drives, a necessity for the invention of personal computers. CP/M sold over 250,000 copies and anticipated much of the later functionality of MS-DOS, the precursor to Microsoft Windows.
- _BIOS_: The Basic Input/Output System, a routine used to initialize the hardware and operating system on a microprocessor. Kildall developed BIOS to enable CP/M to be installed on different hardware without being modified.
- _XLT86_: A compiler that translates source code written for the Intel 8080 microprocessor into source code for the Intel 8086 microprocessor (a **source-to-source compiler** or **transcompiler**). XLT86, released in 1982, was one of the first transcompilers to implement code optimization techniques, which were themselves pioneered by Kildall in his Ph.D. thesis.
- _KnowledgeDisc_: A CD-ROM containing the entirety of _Grolier's Academic Encyclopedia_. Kildall helped develop the file system and data structures for this product, which was released in 1985 as the first commercially-available CD-ROM product. Kildall presented the KnowledgeDisc at a keynote talk at the first annual Microsoft CD-ROM Conference.

## Business Ventures

- _Digital Research, Inc. (DRI)_: A company founded by Kildall to sell operating system software including CP/M and its successors. DRI was sold in 1991 for 80-million USD.
- _Activenture_: A spin-off company from DRI focusing on optical disc technology, such as the CD-ROM. Kildall released the KnowledgeDisc through Activenture.

## Technology Education

- After his Ph.D., Kildall taught computer science for several years at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.
- From 1983 to 1990, Kildall was a co-host of the PBS show _Computer Connections_, which documented developments in the growing personal computer industry.

## Personal Writings

In his last years, Kildall worked on a memoir, titled _Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry_. The first several chapters of this manuscript are available for [free](https://computerhistory.org/blogs/computer-history-museum-license-agreement-for-the-kildall-manuscript/).
