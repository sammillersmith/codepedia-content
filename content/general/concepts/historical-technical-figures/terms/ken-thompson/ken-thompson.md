**Ken Thompson** (1943 - ) is an American computer scientist, known for creating many significant works in the field, such as the [Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/unix) and Plan 9 operating systems, the B (1969) and [Go](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/go) (2019) programming languages, the `grep` command line utility, and UTF-8 encoding.

Ken Thompson is best known for working alongside [Dennis Ritchie](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/dennis-ritchie) and others at Bell Laboratories, where they began working on Unix in 1967 as a replacement operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-7 mini computer.

During this time, Ken Thompson developed the B programming language, which would become the precursor for the incredibly popular and influential [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) programming language.
