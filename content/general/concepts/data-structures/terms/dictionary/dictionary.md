A **dictionary** is an unordered set of (key, value) pairs. It provides a way to map pieces of data to each other, and allows for quick access to values associated to keys.

## Syntax

The syntax of a dictionary is as follows:

```pseudo
dictionary = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  key3: value3
}
```

For example:

```py
coffee_shop = {
  "cold brew": 3.50,
  "latte": 4.25,
  "cappucino": 3.99
}
```
