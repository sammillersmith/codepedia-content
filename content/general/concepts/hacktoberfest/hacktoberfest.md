**Hacktoberfest** is an annual worldwide event that is held in October. It incentivizes developers to contribute to [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) software development.

## Participation and Rewards

Developers can participate by making four pull requests and having them accepted to any public GitHub repository between October 1st and 31st.

Participants who successfully complete the required number of pull requests receive a reward.

While the event encourages contributions, it also emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity. Contributions should follow the guidelines of the respective open-source projects and be meaningful improvements or additions.
