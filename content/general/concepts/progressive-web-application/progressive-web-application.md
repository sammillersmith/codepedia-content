A **progressive web application (PWA)** is software that is built with common web technologies to provide a consistent, browser-based experience across multiple platforms like mobile and desktop. Browser compatibility for PWAs is various but is generally supported in the following:

- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari
- Firefox (for Android, not desktop)
- Microsoft Edge

## PWA Principles

Rather than being a programming language or separate technology, PWAs are a collection of key principles followed in every application, including:

- Discoverable: The app can be readily found on app stores and search engines.
- Installable: The app can be installed as a "native-like app" on a device for later use on the browser.
- Linkable: A secure and unique link can be used to visit and share the app.
- Network independence: The app provides an offline experience with service workers and other web APIs.
- Re-engagement: The app can update content when not in use and push notifications to the user.
- Responsive design: The app's user interface is consistent across all resolutions and screen sizes.
- Secure: The app uses HTTPS for secure browsing.
