**Information Technology**, also known as IT, is the use of digital tools and technologies to store, process, obtain, transmit, and manage useful information. IT encompasses a spectrum of tasks, including designing, implementing, and maintaining systems, networks, databases, and applications. Due to living in a technology-driven world, IT plays a major role in people's lives whether it's fixing a cracked screen on a phone, doing a data transfer from an old computer to another one, or repairing a PC's hardware.

## Roles

These are some common roles in the IT industry:

- Hardware Technicians: Installs, repairs, and maintains [computer hardware](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/computer-hardware). May also be required to troubleshoot hardware and software issues, as well as provide training and support to users on how to use the devices effectively.
- Network Engineers: Designs, plans, and implements network infrastructures ranging from local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and intranets for businesses and organizations.
