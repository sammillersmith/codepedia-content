## Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality

The difference between augmented reality (AR) and [virtual reality (VR)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/virtual-reality) is that augmented reality utilizes the current physical setting of the user while introducing a layer of synthetic digital, sonic or somatic presentation to enhance the user experience whereas VR involves use of a headset to facilitate an experience rooted in the graphic and sonic presentation within the VR setup as opposed to using the individuals more broad physical surroundings for interaction.

Augmented reality is poised to grow substantially in use during the 21st century as it has many potential uses that range from entertainment, medical, commercial, military, fashion and design etc.

## Augmented Reality Examples

- Viewing merchandise/goods without trying them on at retail stores and shopping platforms (IKEA, Neiman Marcus, etc.)
- Flight/Combat simulation (military, commercial aviation)
- Physical markers for direction and navigation
- 3D commercial/residential design and architecture
- Training for medical procedures for nurses and doctors
