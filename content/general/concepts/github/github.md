**GitHub (GH)** is a UI-based version control platform that runs on [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git). It offers many services including version control, static website hosting, [open-source software (OSS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/open-source-software) projects, and much more.

## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a service offered by GH for hosting static websites for free with an unlimited amount of visits. It automatically has encryption with [HTTPS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http). GitHub Pages also supports custom domains.

## Good First Issue

["Good First Issue"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) is a label used by open-source maintainers on GitHub to categorize issues that are intended for people who have little to no experience in making open source contributions or are new to a particular project. It also signifies to maintainers that extra assistance is needed when reviewing a new contributor's pull request, whether it's introducing the contributing guidelines or providing in-line comments on lines of code that need revision. Additionally, there is a compiled list of repositories using the "Good First Issue" label in the [topics section of GitHub](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue).
