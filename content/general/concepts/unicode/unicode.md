**Unicode** is a text-processing standard that assigns a unique number, known as a code point, to each character across most human languages and writing systems. It is device- and platform-agnostic and is maintained by the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/). The adoption of the Unicode standard has grown so much that it is now implemented in many modern operating systems, programming languages, and it is the default encoding used in [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml) and [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html).

## Common Character Sets

Below are some tables of common Unicode character sets.

> **Note:** These tables only showcase a few characters from each set. More information can be found in [the official Unicode character code charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts).
