**Runtime** is the period of time during which a program is running, executing the specific instructions that make up the software.

Runtime errors are common types of errors in software development. A runtime error is any error a program has while it is running.

## Runtime Environment

The runtime environment is the infrastructure required to implement features in the language itself. This can include functions for optimization, memory management, debugging, and input/output. Runtimes make software development easier for engineers by making these functions more accessible.
