A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a software application that allows users to create, edit, and manage digital content such as text, images, videos, and other multimedia files. A CMS typically provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily add, delete, and modify content without the need for technical knowledge or coding skills. The primary purpose of a CMS is to make it easier for organizations to manage and maintain their online presence by providing a central platform for organizing and publishing content.

## CMS Features

A content management system provides a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to easily create, edit, and publish content to a website without having to write any code. The CMS manages all of the underlying technical aspects of the website, such as creating and storing the content in a database, generating the necessary HTML code to display the content on the website, and handling user permissions and other security issues.

A CMS typically has two main components: a content management application (CMA) and a content delivery application (CDA). The CMA is the user interface that allows users to create and manage content, while the CDA is the backend that handles the delivery of the content to the website or other digital platforms. Some common features of a CMS include managing and organizing digital assets, creating and editing content, and controlling access to different users.
