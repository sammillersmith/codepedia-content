A **Uniform Resource Name (URN)** are general [URIs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/uri) that refer to resources without disclosing any location or proof of existence.

## Syntax

```pseudo
urn:nid:data
```

URNs use namespace identifiers (`nid`) that are unique and registered with the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/). The `data` is commonly unique information such as serial numbers.

## Example

Libraries and booksellers may use the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system to catalog and uniquely identify materials in their collection, like so:

```shell
urn:isbn:9781098110338
```
