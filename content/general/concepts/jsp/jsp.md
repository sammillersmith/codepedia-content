**JSP** (Jakarta Server Pages, formerly JavaServer Pages) is a technology that allows a web developer to mix textual content with [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java) code that is executed on the web [server](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server) to [render](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server-side-rendering) the final web page. In this way it is similar to [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) except that it uses the Java programming language. With JSP the developer can create dynamic pages based on [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html), [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml), SOAP, or other document types.

JSP was released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, and version 3.1 was released on April 31, 2022.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

JSP has the following advantages compared to other methods of creating dynamic web pages:

- The execution of JSP pages is faster than other technologies.
- JSP pages are compiled before being processed by the server, reducing the load on the server.
- JSP has access to all the Java APIs.
- Since JSP uses the Java Virtual Machine, it is portable and platform-agnostic.

These are some disadvantages of JSP:

- Debugging and tracing errors can be difficult.
- It uses roughly twice the disk storage as other dynamic web pages.
- A JSP file must be compiled on the server when first accessed, which can cause a noticeable delay on the first visit to a page.
