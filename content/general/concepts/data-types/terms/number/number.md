**Numbers** include `-1`, `0`, `1`, and so on. Depending on the language, numbers with decimals are of a different type. In floating-point arithmetic, there is a trade-off in precision for range. The amount of bits allocated for floating-point representation affects the range in values that can be used.

## Arithmetic Accuracy

Languages such as JavaScript and Python yield interesting results when arithmetic operations are performed on numeric values. For example, `.1 + .2` would evaluate to `0.30000000000000004`, whereas adding whole numbers wouldn't do this. But you need to keep in mind the integer limit. It is the number where the compiler won't understand the numbers anymore.
