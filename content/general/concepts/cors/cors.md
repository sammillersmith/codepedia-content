**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a tool that uses [HTTP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) headers to help [servers](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server) determine which requests from other resources can access the current, cross-origin resource.

In most cases, browsers will make a "preflight" request to the host server to ensure the actual request will work. This is another function of CORS.
