[**WebRTC**](https://webrtc.org/) (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free and open-source collection of APIs that allow peer-to-peer connections between two or more browser clients.

Originally developed in 2011 and currently maintained by Google, WebRTC has been published as a specification by the W3C and is supported by all major browsers.

## WebRTC vs WebSockets

WebRTC is commonly used for video chatting apps because it allows two or more computers to connect and send audiovisual data without needing a server.

Conversely, WebSockets allow for a two-way connection between a server and client using the `ws://` protocol.
