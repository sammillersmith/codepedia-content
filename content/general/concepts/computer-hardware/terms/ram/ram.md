**RAM** is an acronym for **Random Access Memory**, which is a mechanism for storing and retrieving information in random memory units as opposed to other formats that store data in specific memory locations. RAM is considered a volatile place for storage of information due to the fact that data can be lost if power is suddenly unavailable.

## The Two Types of RAM

- Static RAM (SRAM): A form of random access memory which does not need to periodically refresh its memory. Static RAM is more expensive and more complex to manufacture than DRAM due to the fact that SRAM can contain multiple transistors in layered architectures within a memory unit. As a result of this more dense architecture it has more processing power and is faster. SRAM is more prevalent in systems requiring substantial computing power. SRAM is primarily used for CPU Caches in processors.

- Dynamic RAM (DRAM): A form of random access memory which requires the periodic refreshing of data. DRAM is more common than SRAM due to its comparatively simpler mechanical structure. Due to this more simplified structure it is cheaper and easier to manufacture. DRAM is considered main memory in processors.
