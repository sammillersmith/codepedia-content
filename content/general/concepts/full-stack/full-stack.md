**Full-stack** development refers to having competency in both client and server-side software to build entire applications from the [back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/back-end), through [APIs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api), to the [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end). Full-stack developers are able to handle both front-end and back-end tasks. Typically, full-stack developers are stronger in either front or back-end and throughout their careers, gain competence in the full-stack.

## Hiring Trends

Larger companies have the resources to hire large development teams, which allows them to have teams where developers can specialize in either front-end or back-end.

Startups, on the other hand, may be limited in their ability to hire a large development team, so instead will seek full-stack developers. They tend to seek full-stack developers for several reasons, one of which is funding.

## Common Tasks

Full-stack web development can involve a variety of front-end and back-end tasks, including:

- Creating and updating webpages.
- Making sure webpages are responsive and work well on phones or tablets.
- Improving website performance.
- Adding and improving accessibility features.
- Using front-end [frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) to build client-side software.
- Building and consuming APIs.
- Creating, integrating, and managing [databases](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database).
- Using back-end frameworks to build server-side software.
- Validating data to make sure it's formatted correctly before being sent to the database.
- Integrating user-facing elements with server-side elements to make sure that information is being sent to the right place so the server can retrieve it.

## Popular Tech Stacks

Full-stack developers typically utilize a combination of software, called a [tech stack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/tech-stack), in order to build full-stack applications.

### MEXN Stack

This well-known tech stack comes in a few forms but all of them use [MongoDB](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb) (for the database), [Express.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/express) (for the back-end), and [Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/node-js) (for the server). One of the following front-end frameworks is commonly used in this stack:

- [React.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react) (ME**R**N)
- [Angular](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/angular) (ME**A**N
- [Vue](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-vue-js) (ME**V**N)

### LAMP Stack

Technologies in the LAMP stack include some popular [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) projects:

- [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux): Open-source operating system
- Apache: Popular open-source web server software
- MySQL: Database management system
- [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php): Web development programming language

### Django Stack

Highlights for this stack include the use of [Django](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django), a popular [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) framework that is structured around creating templates. This can be used with a front-end framework like Vue for building a web application.
