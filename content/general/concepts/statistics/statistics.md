**Statistics** is the science that is concerned with methods for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting **data**. Data refers to any collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, or descriptive details. In the realm of statistics, data can be used to find correlations, make predictions, and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. Visual representations such as charts make data easier to analyze and understand.

## Fields That Use Statistics

Statistics is used extensively in fields such as computer science, economics, sociology, physics, and many more. It is also a core component of **machine learning**, a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Machine learning algorithms require statistical methods to extract significant patterns, relationships, and insights from complex datasets.

## Working With Data as a Developer

**Python** is the most popular programming language for data science. It is used for data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and many more. Python is a great choice for beginners because it is easy to learn and has a wide range of applications. It has support for libraries such as:

- [NumPy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy) is used for working with arrays and matrices of numerical data. It provides a wide range of mathematical functions and is widely used in scientific computing.
- [Pandas](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/pandas) is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, as well as tools for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- [Matplotlib](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/matplotlib) is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.
- Scikit-learn is used for machine learning in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as tools for model selection and evaluation.
