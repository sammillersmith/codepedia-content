A **parameter** is the name of a variable passed into a function. Parameters allow functions to accept inputs. An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value of the variable (also known as the parameter) passed into a function.

## Example

Suppose we have a function called `tripleThis()`:

```js
function tripleThis(x) {
  return x * 3;
}

tripleThis(6);
```

The parameter is `x` since it is the variable. The argument is `6` since it is the actual value.
