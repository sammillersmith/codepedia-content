Title: 'CDN'
Description: 'Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a method of implementing a cache in the browser which retains copies of web content at various points throughout a network and serves them to clients from the closest network location. This is done by geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. CDNs are among recent innovations in technology which have improved the availability and speed with which we are able to access information on the internet because content that would normally have to travel long distances in order to be consumed by the client are now stored in local hubs geographically close in order to serve it to the user much faster.'

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a method of implementing a cache in the browser which retains copies of web content at various points throughout a network and serves them to clients from the closest network location. This is done by geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

CDN's are among recent innovations in technology which have improved the availability and speed with which we are able to access information on the internet because content that would normally have to travel long distances in order to be consumed by the client are now stored in local hubs geographically close in order to serve it to the user much faster.

## CDN Benefits

- Improving website load times: Pages load much quicker because the resources do not have to retrieve data from long distances. Data is cached locally and served therefore much quicker.
- Reducing bandwidth costs: Due to proximity to the server, data transfer is done with less bandwidth requirements.
- Increasing content availability and redundancy: Having cached details in servers across the globe allows users to consume the data locally and therefore quicker.
- Improving website security: Properly configured CDN's can prevent Denial of Service attacks by distributing the load to servers that can serve the desired resources without being overwhelmed.
