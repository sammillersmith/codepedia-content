**Inheritance** is one of the most important principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows for one class (child class) to inherit the fields and methods of another class (parent class).

An inherited class is also called a subclass of its superclass (parent class).

Inheritance is considered one of the four pillars of OOP, along with abstraction, and encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Example

```java
// Parent Class
class Machine {
  // Machine class member
}

// Child Class
class Car extends Machine {
  // Car inherits traits from Machine

  // Additional Car class members, functions, etc.
}
```
