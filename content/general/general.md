The General section is home to all programming and computer-related concepts that are language-agnostic and do not belong in one of the focused topic areas such as [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai), [cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity), or [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source). These include universal foundational programming terminologies that are often shared among languages and frameworks.
