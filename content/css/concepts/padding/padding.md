The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as _padding_. Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.

## Syntax

In CSS, you can modify this space with the `padding` property.

```css
p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid coral;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

Here, the code added 10 pixels of space between the content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all four sides.

The `padding` property is often used to expand the background color and make the content look less cramped.
