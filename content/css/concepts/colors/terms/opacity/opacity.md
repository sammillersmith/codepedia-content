To measure of how transparent an element is.

## Syntax

```css
opacity: <value>;
```

The `<value>` is measured from 0 to 1:

- 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.
- 1 representing 100%, or fully visible and opaque.

## Example 1

Set the `h1` tag to be 50% visible:

```css
h1 {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```
