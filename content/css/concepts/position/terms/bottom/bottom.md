Specifies the distance of an element from the bottom of its current location if the element itself has `position: relative` declared or from the bottom of its nearest ancestor when the ancestor has `position: relative` and the element has `position: absolute` declared. `position: fixed` positions an element relative to the viewport. It takes the element out of the normal flow and remains fixed, not affected by scrolling.

## Syntax

```css
bottom: <value>;
```

where `<value>` can be one of the following:

- Length value: `20px`
- Percentage value: `5%`
- Keyword value: `auto`, `inherit`

**Note:** If none of the ancestors have `position: relative` declared, the absolute positioned element will traverse the DOM until it reaches the <body> tag, at which point it will position itself at the bottom of the page regardless of its location in the source HTML.

## Example 1

Set the position of `.box` element `40px` from the bottom of the nearest relative position ancestor or from the document if none exist.

```css
.box {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 40px;
}
```

The blue box `position: absolute` is positioned `40px` from the bottom edge of its containing element `position: relative`.

## Example 2

Set the position of `.box` element `40px` from the elements bottom edge.

```css
.box {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  position: relative;
  bottom: 40px;
}
```

The blue box `position: relative` is positioned `40px` above its default position, represented by the dashed box within the containing element `position: relative`.

## Example 3

Set the position of `.box` element `40px` from the bottom edge of the viewport.

```css
.box {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 40px;
}
```

The blue box `position: fixed` is taken out of the normal document flow and its position with the bottom property sets its distance `40px` above the bottom edge of the viewport. It doesn't move when the page is scrolled.
