The Box Model is a CSS layout mechanism that the web browser uses to render content organized by box-shaped elements. Each element is made of four specific areas:

- `width` and `height`: The width and height of the content area.
- `padding`: The amount of space between the content area and the border.
- `border`: The thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
- `margin`: The amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
