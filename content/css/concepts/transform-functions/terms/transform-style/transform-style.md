The `transform-style` property specifies if an element's children are positioned in 3D space or flattened.

## Syntax

```css
transform-style: <value>;
```

The `transform-style` property can have one of two values:

- `preserve-3d`: The children of an element will be positioned in 3D space.
- `flat`: The children of an element will not be positioned in 3D space.

## Example 1

Preserving the 3D space of a `div` element's children elements.

```css
div {
  transform-style: center;
}
```
