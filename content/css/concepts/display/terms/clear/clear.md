Specifies whether an element coming after a floated element should be moved down or not.

## Syntax

```css
clear: value;
```

The `value` for the `clear` attribute can be:

- `none`: The element is not moved down to clear past floating elements (the default).
- `left`: The element is moved down to clear past _left_ floated elements.
- `right`: The element is moved down to clear past _right_ floated elements.
- `both`: The element is moved down to clear past both _left_ and _right_ floated elements.

## Example 1

Making an `img` element move down a _left_ floated `h1` element.

```css
.div1 h1 {
  float: left;
}

.div1 img {
  clear: left;
}
```

The image below matches the code example. The `h1` element is floated to the left due to `float: left`. The `img` element is then moved under the `h1` element due to `clear: left`.
