To set the text to be thicker or thinner.

## Syntax

```css
font-weight: font-weight-value;
```

The `font-style-value` can be the following:

- `normal`
- `bolder`
- `bold`
- `initial`
- `inherit`
- `lighter`

or can be in the form of numerical values from `100` to `900`. The default value is `normal` while the default numerical value is `400`.

## Example

Set the `p` tag to `bold`:

```css
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

The image below shows what text looks like with a bold `font-weight`:

Set the `p` tag to `600`:

```css
p {
  /* This code snippet gives the text a semi-bold style */
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

The image below shows what text looks like when the `font-weight` is set to 600:

> **Note:** The way `font-weight` renders can differ from browser to browser. For certain languages, it is not advised to use `font-weight`. This includes languages with complex scripts such as Chinese and Japanese.
