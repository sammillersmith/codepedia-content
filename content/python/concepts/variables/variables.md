Title: 'Variables'
Description: 'A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character . The equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, grade, grocerylist). Rules for Python variables: - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. It cannot start with a number. - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _). - Variable names are case-sensitive (num, Num, and NUM are three different variables).'

A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character `_`.

The equal sign `=` is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed.

## Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like `x` and `y`) or a more descriptive name (`age`, `grade`, `grocery_list`).

Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. It cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (`A`-`z`, `0`-`9`, and `_`).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`num`, `Num`, and `NUM` are three different variables).

## Examples

These are all valid variable names and assignment:

```py
user_name = "@sonny420"
user_id = 100
verified = False
```

A variable's value can be changed after assignment

```codebyte/py
points = 100
points = 120

print(points)
```
