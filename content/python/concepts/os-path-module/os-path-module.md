The **`os.path` module** supports operations on pathnames, which can be passed as strings or bytes. The functions under `os.path` differ from the ones under the [`glob`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/glob-module) module in that they are used for working with and creating specific paths (rather than just filtering through them under certain criteria).
