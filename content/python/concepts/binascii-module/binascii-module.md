The **`binascii`** module contains a number of methods to convert between binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. It is a valuable resource when dealing with binary data in various contexts, such as network protocols and file handling. Normally, a developer will not use these functions directly but use wrapper modules like `uu` or `base64` instead. The `binascii` module contains low-level functions written in C for greater speed that are used by the higher-level modules. The Python `binascii` module is a valuable tool when working with binary data and encoding it into different text formats or decoding text representations back into binary data.

The following functions are provided by the `binascii` module:
