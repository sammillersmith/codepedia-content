**Regex**, short for [regular expressions](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/regular-expressions), is a powerful system for searching text. Regular expressions are implemented in a variety of languages including Java and Python.

## Syntax

Regular expressions are accessed by importing the `re` module:

```pseudo
import re

regex = r"this is a regex pattern"
```

For the most part, regex patterns are expressed with raw string notation (hence, the preceding `r` character).
