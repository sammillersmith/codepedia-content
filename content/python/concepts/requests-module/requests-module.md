The **`requests`** module is the de facto standard for sending [HTTP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) requests in Python.

It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind an [API](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api) so that code can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in the application.

The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

## Installation

Installing the `requests` module is done by running the following [pip](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pip) command in the [terminal](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/command-line/terminal):

```shell
pip install requests
```

Or for Python 3:

```shell
pip3 install requests
```

Once `requests` is installed, it can be used in a program and imported like this:

```py
import requests
```
