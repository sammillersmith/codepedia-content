The **`json` module** provides tools for working with the [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/json) format. It can be imported with the following line:

```py
import json
```

JSON in Python is based on the object-literal syntax of [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript). The following Python [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/data-types) can be converted to JSON strings in Python:

- Booleans (`bool` type)
- [Dictionaries](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries) (`dict` type)
- Number types (i.e., `int` and `float`)
- Sequence types (i.e., [lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) and [tuples](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/tuples))
- [Strings](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings) (`str` type)
- `NoneType`

The following functions are provided by the `json` module:
