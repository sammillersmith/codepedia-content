The **`__repr__()`** dunder method returns the string representation of the object or class. This overwrites the built-in `repr()` function.

## Syntax

```pseudo
class ClassName:
  def __repr__(self):
```

The `__repr__()` method accepts no parameters. `self` is an implicit reference to the instance of `ClassName`.

## Codebyte Example

A class string representation can be seen by calling [`print()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/built-in-functions/print) on the instance. In the following example, the `__repr__()` method is written to return a formatted string representation of the `Home` class (with the help of the [`.format()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings/format) string function):

```codebyte/python
class Home:
  def __init__(self, rooms, stories):
    self.rooms = rooms
    self.stories = stories

  def __repr__(self):
    return "Home with {} rooms and {} stories".format(self.rooms, self.stories)

home1 = Home(4, 2)
print(home1)

home2 = Home(5, 2)
print(home2)
```
