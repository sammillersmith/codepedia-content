The **`__init__()`** method initializes a newly created object. It is called each time a new instance of the defined class is created.

## Syntax

```pseudo
class ClassName:
  def __init__(self, param1, param2, ..., paramN):
    self.param1 = param1
    self.param2 = param2
    self.paramN = paramN
    self.default_param = value
```

In a class definition, instance attributes can be set within the `__init__()` in two ways:

- With named parameters (`param1, param2, ..., paramN`) that will be required when a class instance is created.
- A `default_param` and corresponding `value` can also be defined so that every instance has access to this parameter.

Additionally, instance attributes can be added to a specific instance variable afterwards:

```pseudo
new_class_instance = ClassName(value1, value2, ..., valueN)
new_class_instance.specific_variable = new_value
```

## Codebyte Example

The example below showcases the `__init__()` method being implicitly called after a new instance of the `Home` class, `home`, is created with `rooms` and `stories` attributes passed in:

```codebyte/python
class Home:
  def __init__(self, rooms, stories):
    # Setting instance variables
    self.rooms = rooms
    self.stories = stories

home = Home(4, 2)

print(home.rooms)
print(home.stories)
```
