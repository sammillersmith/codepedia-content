**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from bad actors who disrupt services or steal sensitive information. The responsibilities of professionals in this field may include:

- Educating a company's stakeholders on the importance of cyber and information security.
- Planning in disaster recovery and responses to cybersecurity breaches.
- Closing gaps in network security and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Defending against various [cyber-attacks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack).

As a concept, cybersecurity covers everything from network and application security to operational security and business continuity.

## Programming Languages

Cybersecurity work involves the following programming languages:

- [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) features tools for common tasks such as malware analysis.
- [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) and [C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp) are low-level languages that can directly access RAM and system processes.
- [SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql) and its features are used in database security.
- [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) can be used to protect against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
- [Bash](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/command-line/bash) can automate tasks, manage configurations, and analyze system data.
- [PowerShell](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/powershell) like BASH, is used in automating tasks and analyzing system data.
