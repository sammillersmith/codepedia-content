The most basic type of **scan** is done with the command-line interface (CLI) command `nmap` with just a target specified. The target is the IP address or domain name being scanned. It should be a domain the user owns or one the user has written permission to scan.

## Syntax

```pseudo
nmap target
```

Where `target` is the IP address or domain name being scanned. The command by itself scans 1,000 TCP ports on the target host.

Nmap divides ports into one of six states:

- `open`: The port is open and actively accepting connections.
- `closed`: The port is accessible, but no application is accepting connections through it.
- `filtered`: Nmap can't tell if the port is open because a firewall or other packet filtering is preventing access.
- `unfiltered`: The port is accessible, but Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed.
- `open|filtered`: Nmap cannot tell if a port is open or filtered.
- `closed|filtered`: Nmap cannot tell if a port is closed or filtered.

## Example

```shell
nmap scanme.nmap.org
```

> **Note:** `scanme.nmap.org` is a domain set up explicitly for people to test Nmap with.

The output of this command looks like this:

```shell
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-10-25 12:22 Eastern Daylight Time
