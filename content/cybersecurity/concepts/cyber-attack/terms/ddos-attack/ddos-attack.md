A **DDoS**, or Distributed Denial of Service, is a cyber attack where a company or organization's websites and servers are overwhelmed by traffic as a result of a coordinated effort by a hacker or group. These individuals often use botnets, devices they hijack without the owners' knowledge, as a weapon of choice. However, hackers may use other methods, such as amplifying requests to a system that can cause disruptions of service and damages due to the inability of the system(s) to handle the flood of malicious or false requests.

## Types of DDOS Attacks

DDoS attacks can be separated into three categories:

1. Volumetric(raw attack volume) attacks: Utilizes methods to generate volumes of online traffic to a company's website, causing its bandwidth to be saturated and destabilizing the flow of online accessibility.
2. Protocol attacks: Destroys the processing capacity of network infrastructure resources like servers, firewalls, and load balancers. This happens when malicious connection requests are made through Layer 3 and 4 protocol connection requests.
3. Application Attacks: Opens connections and initiating process and transaction requests that consume finite resources like disk space and memory storage. This occurs when weaknesses in the application layer are manipulated.

## Signs of a DDOS-infected device

- Slow access to files.
- Unable to access a specific website.
- No internet access.
- Spam emails to contacts.

## How to Respond to a DDOS Attack

- Provide training for staff members to recognize the signs of a DDoS attack.
- Use online outage mitigation and response strategies.
- Assess ongoing DDoS risks through tests that mimic these attacks.
- Implement specialized tools that can handle the overflow of high Web traffic. Cloud-based Web servers like [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/) are often recommended for this task.
