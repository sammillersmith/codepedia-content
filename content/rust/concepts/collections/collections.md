In Rust, **collections** are fundamental data structures offered by the standard library, enabling the storage and manipulation of multiple values. These dynamic structures differ from fixed-size `arrays` and `tuples` by allowing a variable number of elements. The key advantage lies in their ability to dynamically allocate memory on the heap, which means that the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can shrink and grow during runtime. The most commonly used collection data types include `vector`, `string`, and `Hashmap`. The rest include `VecDeque`, `LinkedList`, `BTreeMap`, `set`, and `BinaryHeap`.
