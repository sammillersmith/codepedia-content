**Rust** is a programming language first released in 2015. With its focus on type safety, concurrency, and performance, it is a safe and practical language to write low-level code while avoiding some of the drawbacks and security vulnerabilities associated with other languages like [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) and [C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp).

Rust is very useful in situations requiring system-level programming, such as operating systems, web servers, game engines, and more.

## Advantages

Rust has several advantages including its:

- **Concurrency Support:** With its model based on ownership and borrowing, Rust has built-in support for concurrency and parallel programming.
- **Ecosystem:** There are several of libraries and frameworks available for use within Rust. It also has Cargo, a command line tool that can be used to manage dependencies, create documentation, test code, and more.
- **Efficiency:** Rust is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for performance-critical applications like systems programming.
- **Cross-Platform:** Code can be run across various operating systems and hardware architectures.
