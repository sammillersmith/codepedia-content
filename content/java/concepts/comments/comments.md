A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

## Single-line Comments

In Java, single-line comments are created with two consecutive forward slashes `//`.

```js
// I am a single-line comment!
System.out.println('Hello, world!');
```

A single-line comment can also be used to comment after a line of code:

```js
System.out.println('Hello, world!'); // Me, too!
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.

```java
/*
And I am a
multi-line comment!
*/
```
