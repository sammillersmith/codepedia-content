The Java `Math` class provides several static methods that allows us to work on mathematical calculations with numbers. These methods can be accessed by using the `Math` class with a given method:

```pseudo
Math.method();
```

## Math Constants

There are several mathematical constants defined in the Java `Math` class. These constants are marked as public static final, which means they are public, class-level constants with unchangeable values and can be accessed as follows:

|   Name    |       value       |                                        Definition                                         |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `Math.PI` | 3.141592653589793 |               This constant represents the mathematical constant Ï€ (_pi_).                |
| `Math.E`  | 2.718281828459045 | This constant represents the base of the natural logarithm, also known as Euler's number. |

## Math Methods

Here are the `Math` methods in alphabetical order:
