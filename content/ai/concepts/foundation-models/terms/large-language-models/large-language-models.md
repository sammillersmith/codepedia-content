**Large language models (LLMs)** are artificial intelligence systems that are designed to process and generate human language on a massive scale. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use advanced machine learning algorithms to learn the patterns and structures of language. LLMs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to perform a wide range of language-related tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering.

LLMs typically consist of a large neural network architecture that is trained on massive datasets. These models are trained using [unsupervised learning](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/machine-learning) techniques, which means that they do not require explicit human supervision to learn. Instead, they learn from the patterns and structures present in the data.

LLMs are typically evaluated on their ability to perform a specific task, such as language translation or text generation. They are often fine-tuned on smaller datasets to improve their performance on specific tasks. However, the use of these models has raised concerns about their ethical implications, particularly with regard to bias and the potential for misuse.

## Existing LLMs

Large language models are a powerful tool for processing and generating human language, and their applications are likely to grow in the years to come. Some examples of existing LLMs are:

- [OpenAI's](https://openai.com) GPT series
- Google's BERT and LaMDA (powers Bard)
- Facebook's [RoBERTa](https://www.open-roberta.org)
