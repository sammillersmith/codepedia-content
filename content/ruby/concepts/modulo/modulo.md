A Ruby function that returns the modular value, the remainder, when two numbers are divided.

## Syntax

```ruby
x.modulo(y)
```

- where `x` is the dividend and `y` is the divisor. Two values are required.

## Example 1

```ruby
puts 5.modulo(3)
# Output: 2
```

- `5` is divided by `3` and the remainder is `2`.

## Example 2

```ruby
puts 10.modulo(3)
# Output: 1
```

- `10` is divided by `3` and the remainder is `1`.
