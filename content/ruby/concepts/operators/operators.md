## Arithmetic Operators

Basic math operations can be applied to integer and floating point values:

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `%` modulo (yields the remainder)

```ruby
a = 30;
b = 20;

puts a + b
# Output: 50

puts a - b
# Output: 10

puts a * b
# Output: 600
puts a / b
# Output: 1.5
puts a % b
# Output: 10
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators can be used to compare two values:

- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

The result of a comparison is a boolean value `true` or `false`:

```ruby
a = 5;
b = 3;

puts a > b;
# Output: true
```
