The **`.length`** property returns the number of characters in a string.

## Syntax

```pseudo
string.length
```

The `string` can either be a literal sequence of characters surrounded by quotes or a variable that refers to such a sequence.

## Codebyte Example

In the example below, the `.length` property of the variable `greeting` is logged to the console:

```codebyte/ruby
greeting = "Hi, internet!"
puts greeting.length
```
