The **command line** is a text-based interface used in most operating systems for a variety of tasks including:

- Navigating and interacting with the computer's [file system structure](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/file-system-structure).
- Running programs or launching applications written in a particular [tech stack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/tech-stack),
- Configuring the command line environment (e.g., aliases and `PATH` variable).

The command line is also referred to as the command line interface (CLI).
