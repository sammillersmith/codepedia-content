The `<aside>` semantic HTML element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element,but isnâ€™t required in order to understand the main content.

## Common Uses

It can be used for related links, for clarifying a statement from the current article, for a sidebar or a location where it doesn't obstruct the main piece of content.

An example of this would be an article that discusses how to take care of a dog and next to the article an advertisement would appear advertising a dog grooming product. The ad would be in the `<aside>` element.

Other uses:

- Bibliographies
- Endnotes
- Comments
- Pull quotes
- Editorial sidebars
- Additional information

## Syntax

```html
<aside>
  <!-- Aside content goes inside the tag -->
</aside>
```

`<aside>` is a tag that wraps around a block of HTML giving it semantic meaning. It has no special attributes, and by default will act similarly to a `<div>`.

## Example

Suppose the current page wants to feature a definition of an important term without having it be a part of the text the term appears in:

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <article>
      <h2>Functional Programming in JavaScript</h2>
      <!-- Lots of paragraphs before this point -->
      <p>
        One of the fun things we can do with functional programming in
        JavaScript is <b>currying</b>. Here we have an example of taking a
        function with two inputs and turning it into a curried version
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          <b>Definition</b>: Currying is the process of converting a function
          with multiple inputs into a sequence of functions, each taking a
          single argument and returning the next function in the sequence. The
          final function in the sequence will then return the same value that
          the original function would have returned.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <code>
        <!-- Code snippet for article goes here -->
      </code>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

We could use CSS to pull that `<aside>` to the right side of the current article, and have it stand out as a thing worth reading that is in service to the current text.
