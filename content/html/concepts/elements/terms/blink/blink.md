The `<blink>` element is an obsolete tag that was historically used to make text flash on and off. However, it is now considered to be obsolete and non-standard.

> **Note**: This is now deprecated from most browsers, and is not part of the current [HTML specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). Using this tag is a bad design practice and is heavily discouraged by [accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The [CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/) allows browsers to ignore this tag.

## Syntax

```html
<!-- Not advised to use this tag! -->
<blink><!-- Blinking text goes here --></blink>
```
