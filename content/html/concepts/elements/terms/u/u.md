The **`<u>`** element is used to mark HTML text to be displayed with a non-textual annotation. The default rendering of this tag is a simple solid underline, but it may be altered using [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css).

> **Note:** Original legacy usage of this element was just to underline text, but it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Modern best practice to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) for text formatting. The CSS element used for underlining text is [`text-decoration`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/text-decoration).

## Syntax

```pseudo
<u>
  <!-- Text that should be annotated goes here -->
</u>
```

The `<u>` element should only contain text content or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>
  You can use this element to indicate things such as <u>misspelt</u> words.
</p>
```
