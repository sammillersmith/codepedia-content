The **`<i>`** element is used to set off HTML text, indicating idiomatic expressions, technical terms, taxonomical designations, and so on. This is commonly illustrated by displaying the text in italics.

**Note:** Original legacy usage of this tag was just to italicize text, but it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Best practice to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) for text formatting. The CSS element used to italicize text is [`font-style`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-style).

## Syntax

```html
<i>
  <!-- Text which should be set off goes here -->
</i>
```

The `<i>` element should only contain text content or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>The technical term for this element is the <i>Idiomatic Text</i> Element</p>
```
