The **`<h_>`** elements represent text headings for sections of content. They range from `<h1>` being the highest level of heading to `<h6>` being the lowest.

## Syntax

```html
<h1>
  <!-- Text for heading goes here -->
</h1>
```

`<h1>` contains text-based information and can include other tags meant for text, like links.

## Example

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Title of the Page</h2>

    <h2>Name of First Section</h2>
    <p>Text from first section.</p>

    <h2>Name of Second Section</h2>
    <p>Text from second section.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
