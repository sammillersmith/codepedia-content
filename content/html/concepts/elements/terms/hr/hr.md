The **`<hr>`** (or horizontal rule) element represents a semantic line break between text elements (e.g., a topic-change within a section).

> **Note:** While the `<hr>` element was originally created for visual purposes, it is now used for semantic distinction. Styling with [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) is now recommended for creating a horizontal line for presentational purposes.

## Syntax

```html
<hr />
```

The `<hr>` element is self-closing and the forward slash `/` is optional. This should be used to semantically separate other elements (e.g., a topic-change within a section).

## Example

In the following example, the `<hr>` element provides a semantic break between the text of two [`<p>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/p) elements:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a different paragraph.</p>
```
