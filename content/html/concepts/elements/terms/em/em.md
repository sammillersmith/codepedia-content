The **`<em>`** element represents text which is emphasized. Browsers will show the enclosed text in italics, by default.

## Syntax

```html
<em><!-- Emphasized text goes here --></em>
```

Text is wrapped in opening and closing `<em>` tags. By default, `<em>` is an inline element, and will be shown in italics.

## Example

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The words 'very important' will be emphasized -->
    <p>
      Here is some text, and this part is <em>very important</em>. I hope you
      enjoy it.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
