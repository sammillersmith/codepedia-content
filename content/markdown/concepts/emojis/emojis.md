In Markdown, **emojis** are symbols that are conveyed via text and/or shortcodes.

## Syntax

When using Markdown, emojis can be copied and pasted straight from sources like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/):

```md
Markdown for a specific text image of emoji
```

Another method to use are shortcodes, emojis being described through words. These vary from application to application, so it's important to refer to their Markdown style guide to ensure that the emojis are described accordingly.

```md
: emoji:
```

## Example 1: Markdown

An emoji is copied from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and used to signify the role being described in the heading below:

```md
### Content Writing Team üìù
```

## Example 2: Emoji Shortcodes

In the paragraph below, the shortcode is conveyed in accordance with [GitHub's standards](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#using-emoji):

```md
Don't forget to leave a star on our repository! :star:
```
