In Markdown, **highlights** are used to emphasize important words. Parts of the text appear in a yellow background after being inserted between two pairs of equal signs (`==`).

> **Note:** This feature is not offered in all markdown processors. Use the HTML [`<mark>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/semantic-html/mark) tag as an alternate way to highlight text.

## Syntax

```pseudo
==Text==
```

## Example

Below, the range of numbers in the baking tip is highlighted so that users pay attention to the amount of cookies they will have based on the amount of dough made:

```md
Depending on how much cookie dough you eat, you’ll have about ==20-22== cookies from this recipe!
```

This will display as:

Depending on how much cookie dough you eat, you’ll have about <mark>20-22</mark> cookies from this recipe!
