Emphasis can be added by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks `**` or underscores `__` before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```md
**bold text**
```

For example:

```md
Please do **NOT** touch your pimples.
```

The output would be:

> Please do **NOT** touch your pimples.

## Italic

Text can be italicized by surrounding with either one asterisk `*` or one underscore `_` on each side. Parts of a word can even be italicized by surrounding the letters with one asterisk, no spaces.

```md
_Italic text_ is *awe*some!
```

For example:

```md
This avocado egg sandwich is _very_ good.
```

The output would be:

> This avocado egg sandwich is _very_ good.

## Strikethrough

A strikethrough can be applied to text by surrounding with two tildes `~~`, like in the example below:

```md
I did ~~not~~ build a website.
```

The output would be:

> I did ~~not~~ build a website.

## Emphasis Combinations

Different formatting options can be combined:

```md
**This is in bold, _italics_, ~~and strikethrough~~**
```

> **This is in bold, _italics_, ~~and strikethrough~~**
