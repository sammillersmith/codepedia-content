In Markdown, items can be organized into ordered and unordered lists.

## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add numbers followed by periods.

```md
1. 🌡 Preheat oven to 325°F
2. 🍪 Drop cookie dough
3. ⏰ Bake for 15 min
```

The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

It will look like:

1. 🌡 Preheat oven to 325°F
2. 🍪 Drop cookie dough
3. ⏰ Bake for 15 min

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes `-`, asterisks `*`, or plus signs `+` in front of line items.

```md
- 🎸 Play more music
- 📚 Read more books
- 👩 Code more stuff
```

It will look like:

- 🎸 Play more music
- 📚 Read more books
- 👩 Code more stuff

Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Indented item
  - Indented item
- Fourth item
```
