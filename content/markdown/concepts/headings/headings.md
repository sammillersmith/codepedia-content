Headings are titles or subtitles that can be used with Markdown. There is a total of 6 different heading options.

To create a heading, add pound symbols `#` to the front of a word or phrase.

The number of number signs used should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three `<h3>`, use three number signs (e.g., `### My Header`).

## Syntax

```md
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6
```

## Alternate Syntax

Alternatively, on the line below the text:

- Add any number of `==` characters for heading level 1
- Add any number or `--` characters for heading level 2.

```md
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2
```

## Best Practices

Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (`#`) and the heading name.

For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

âœ… Do: `# Breaking News`

ðŸš« Don't: `#Breaking News`

Headings should have a blank line above and below for compatibility and readability:

```md
... text ends here.

# Heading

More text starts here.
```

## Example

```md
# Headings

This page is about headings.
