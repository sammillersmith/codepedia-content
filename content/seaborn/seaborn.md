[**Seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (styled as "seaborn") is an [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) Python library used for visualizing the explorative statistical plots of data. It is a basic library used to extract various information that can provide an understanding of a dataset.

## Installation

Guides for installing and getting started with seaborn can be found [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html). It runs on Python 3.7+ and requires the following dependencies:

- [pandas](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/pandas)
- [matplotlib](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/matplotlib)
- [NumPy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy)

The official release of seaborn can be installed with [pip](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pip):

```shell
pip install seaborn
```

The `seaborn` library can be imported (usually with an alias called `sns`). However, individual functions or modules can be imported as well:

```py
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.object as so
```
