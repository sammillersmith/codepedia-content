Procedures are blocks of SQL code that are saved in a database and can be executed repeatedly on demand. Also referred to as stored procedures â€” they can be defined with parameters to be used within the body of the procedure, produce an output value, or both.

The syntax for creating a procedure varies depending upon the type of database management system (DBMS) being used. Below is an example procedure defined and executed with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) that accepts two parameters and returns an output value.

## MySQL Example

```sql
# Set the default delimiter so the procedure can include semicolons
DELIMITER //

# Create the procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE add_int (IN x INT, IN y INT, OUT z INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT x + y INTO z;
END //

# Set the delimiter back to the default
DELIMITER ;

# Execute the stored procedure
CALL add_int (5, 3, @z);
# Return the output parameter
SELECT @z AS Result;
```

Output:

| Result |
| ------ |
| 8      |
