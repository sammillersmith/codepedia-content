Title: 'SQL'
Description: 'SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in these relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and it helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size. We live in a data-informed world, and there are many businesses that store their information inside large, relational databases. This makes SQL a great skill not only for data scientists and engineers, but for anyone wanting to be data-literate.'
