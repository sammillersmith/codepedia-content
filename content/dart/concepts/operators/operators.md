Operators in Dart are special symbols or phrases used to perform operations on variables and values. Dart, like many other programming languages, includes a variety of operators to manipulate data in different ways. These operators are categorized into several types based on their functionality: arithmetic, equality and relational, type test, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.

## Syntax

Operators in Dart follow typical programming syntax and are used in conjunction with operands. The general syntax can be described as:

```dart
operand1 operator operand2
```

## Example

Here is a simple Dart program that demonstrates the use of various operators:

```dart
void main() {
  // Arithmetic Operators
  int a = 10;
  int b = 5;
  print('a + b = ${a + b}');
  print('a - b = ${a - b}');
  print('a * b = ${a * b}');
  print('a / b = ${a / b}');
  print('a % b = ${a % b}');
  print('a ~/ b = ${a ~/ b}');

  // Equality and Relational Operators
  print('a == b: ${a == b}');
  print('a != b: ${a != b}');
  print('a > b: ${a > b}');
  print('a < b: ${a < b}');
  print('a >= b: ${a >= b}');
  print('a <= b: ${a <= b}');

  // Logical Operators
  bool x = true;
  bool y = false;
  print('x && y: ${x && y}');
  print('x || y: ${x || y}');
  print('!x: ${!x}');

  // Bitwise Operators
  int c = 3;
  int d = 5;
  print('c & d: ${c & d}');
  print('c | d: ${c | d}');

  // Assignment Operators
  int e = 5;
  e += 2;
  print('e: $e');
}
```

The above code will give the following output:

```shell
a + b = 15
a - b = 5
a * b = 50
a / b = 2
a % b = 0
a ~/ b = 2
a == b: false
a != b: true
a > b: true
a < b: false
a >= b: true
a <= b: false
x && y: false
x || y: true
!x: false
c & d: 1
c | d: 7
e: 7
```
