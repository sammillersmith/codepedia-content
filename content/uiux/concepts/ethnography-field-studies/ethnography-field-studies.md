**Ethnography and field studies** are [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) methods that draw from anthropology to study how users behave in context. These methods observe behavior in a natural setting and often occur over time, offering more long-term or continuous insight into participant behavior.

## Techniques

Common ethnography techniques in user research include:

- **Field studies**: Field studies refer to any studies conducted in the participant's natural context or location.
- **Contextual inquiry**: Researchers conduct an interview in context as participants complete tasks.
- **Digital ethnography**: Researchers observe an online community or space.
- **Auto-ethnography**: The researcher is the subject of their own study, and examines their own behavior.

Anthropologist [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead) once said, “What people say, what people do, and what people say they do are entirely different things.” [Behavioral research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/behavioral-research) methods like ethnography and field studies offer insight into what people do in practice, alongside [attitudinal research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research) methods that focus on what people say.

## Role of the Researcher

In ethnographic research, the researcher may navigate the group being studied as a participant, observer, or somewhere in between. In some longitudinal ethnographic studies, researchers who begin as observers may become more involved in the communities they are studying as a participant over time.

Researchers should also consider the ethics of whether to disclose their identity as a researcher to the study group (overt) vs. whether to conceal their identity (covert), and how knowledge of the researcher's presence might influence the behavior of those being studied (the [Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)).
