**High-fidelity** refers to design [deliverables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/deliverables) that are realistic and near final-product quality.

High-fidelity prototypes, for example, are used to work through more granular questions about visual design and content and are often created after a team has aligned around topics, like structure, using lower-fidelity wireframes.

High-fidelity prototypes help answer questions like:

- Are stylistic elements such as typeface, font size, and font color legible and appropriate?
- Is the color scheme well-aligned to the brand or product?
- Does the page design and style guide meet accessibility standards?
- Does a particular tagline work alongside a particular image?
- Does this video or image thumbnail work well and draw attention within the context of the page?
