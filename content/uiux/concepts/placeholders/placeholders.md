When creating [sketches](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching) or [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe), [low-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/low-fidelity) **placeholders** are used to represent [high-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) content such as text, images, and videos. [Wireframe elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe-elements) are an example of placeholder content. Indicating the use and placement of an element, without emphasis on how the content will appear visually, is what placeholders achieve.
