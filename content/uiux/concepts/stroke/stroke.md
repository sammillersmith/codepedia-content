A **stroke**, also referred to as a border, is a line that wraps around a layer. In [design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software), the stroke properties can be updated to customize its style, size, and color.

### Stroke Properties

- A stroke can be solid or dashed. A **solid** stroke is an uninterrupted line. A **dashed** stroke consists of dashes or small lines spaced at uniform intervals.
- The stroke’s color and [opacity](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/opacity) can be updated from the [color picker](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/color-picker).
- The **weight**, or thickness, can be increased to make the stroke more perceivable.
- The **position**, or where the stroke sits on the layer, can be set to outside, inside, or center.
- The **join**, or how the stroke meets at the corners, can be set to miter, bevel, or round. Note that the join style does not impact the shape’s [corner radius](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/corner-radius).
