**Annotations** are often in the form of notes or comments that are included in design [deliverables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/deliverables). Annotations within a design deliverable look like this:

Annotations provide additional context and further explanation of what is included in the design and why design decisions were carried out. When presenting [low-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/low-fidelity) deliverables to stakeholders, annotations offer a further explanation when it may be hard to interpret designs without the visual assistance of [high-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) design elements.
