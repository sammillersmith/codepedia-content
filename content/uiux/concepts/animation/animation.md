Apps, websites, and other digital products include **animations** for many reasons, such as drawing the user’s attention to a particular area or providing visual feedback when the user interacts with a design element. Animation can support usability or undermine it, as discussed in [Nielsen Norman Group’s article about the role of animation in UX](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/animation-purpose-ux/).

In the example above, moving the cursor over a particular Codecademy course or path triggers an animation. In UI and UX design projects, animations add motion, which transforms static designs into interactive prototypes. [Design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software) includes features for adding animations that simulate how a user will navigate through the design and interact with it.

### Animation Settings

While variation exists across design software, standard animation settings include the following:

- **Duration**, typically measured in milliseconds, is how long the animation lasts.
- **Style** correlates to how the animation looks. For example, "Dissolve" creates a fading effect, and "Bounce" evokes a ball bouncing up and down.
- **Easing** refers to the way an animation accelerates throughout its duration. Adjusting the easing further customizes the visual style of the motion. Check out this [resource from Figma about easing](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051748654/) to explore how different easing options impact the animation.

[This article from Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/human-computer-interaction/animation-principles-for-ux-designers/) about animation principles discusses how to apply animations to a prototype.
