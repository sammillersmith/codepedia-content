**Fills** refer to the color or image that is applied within a layer's bounds. In [design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software), a layer can have one fill, multiple fills, or no fill. Generally, the default fill is a solid color with 100% [opacity](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/opacity). Fill settings can be adjusted in the [color picker](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/color-picker).
