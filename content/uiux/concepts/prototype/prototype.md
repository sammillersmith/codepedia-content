A **prototype** is an interactive design that maps out interactions and workflows in a digital product. Design software like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) allows designers to transform static designs into clickable prototypes.

When designing a product, [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe) are typically created before a prototype is made. A prototype builds upon the structural layout of wireframes by integrating higher-fidelity design elements and interactivity.

In the prototyping process, key interactions and [user workflows](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-workflows) are planned out to visualize how users may navigate through the product. Designers can evaluate and iterate on these interactions and flows through [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) methods like usability testing, where participants interact with the prototype.

In addition to leveraging user research, effective prototypes incorporate best practices from [interaction design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interaction-design), such as [usability heuristics](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/usability-heuristics).
