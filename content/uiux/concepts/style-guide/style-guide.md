In UI and UX design, a **style guide** documents guidelines to create consistency across visual design and branding elements, such as approved colors, logo treatments, and typefaces. Some style guides may include further guidance on written content, UX copy, or [interaction design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interaction-design). A brandâ€™s style guide is often documented as part of a larger [design system](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-system).

Different organizations document their design systems differently, and different aspects of the system may live within different tools. For example, some organizations might maintain an internal wiki with their style guide, while their component library is maintained in [digital design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software) like Figma or Sketch for easy duplication into new design prototypes.
