**Diary studies** are a form of [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) that collect longitudinal, or longer-term, qualitative data from participants by asking them to complete entries in a diary which may include a series of prompts. Diary studies allow participants to complete entries at their own pace in a natural context without a researcher looking over their shoulder, and allow researchers to examine how participant attitudes and behavior evolve over a set time period.

Because diary studies rely on data self-reported by users, they are considered an [attitudinal research method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research). Diary studies are considered a [qualitative research method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/qualitative-research) since they focus on the in-depth motivations and thought processes behind the user experience.

## Forms of Diary Study

There are many different forms a diary study can take and ways to get creative with this research method.

In terms of timing, diary studies may use the following protocols:

- Interval-contingent protocol where participants report their experience at predetermined intervals (e.g. daily).
- Signal-contingent protocol where participants report their experience when prompted by a signaling device.
- Event-contingent protocol where participants report each time a specific event occurs.

Diaries might be recorded through a diary-specific tool like [dscout](https://dscout.com/) or [Indeemo](https://indeemo.com/), a multi-purpose survey or form tool like [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/), or even using pen and paper. Participants might be asked to include photos or drawings with their submissions, or other more creative prompts &mdash; it's totally up to the researcher!

Because of the time investment required for diary studies and the potential for participant drop off, it's a good practice to offer incentives or compensation at different stages of the study to keep participants engaged. Diary studies may be combined with or used as a warm-up for follow-up [interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interviews) to explore themes from specific participants in further depth.
