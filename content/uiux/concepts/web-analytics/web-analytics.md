**Web analytics** are a measurement of user behavior on a website or app, providing insight into how users are interacting with a design. Web analytics trends can reveal issues with content, navigation, visual design, and other aspects of a product or design. While they are commonly associated with marketing, web analytics are also helpful for [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research).

Web analytics are a source of [quantitative](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/quantitative-research) data, since they can be measured numerically, and are considered a [behavioral research method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/behavioral-research), since they observe real user behavior. Web analytics are an evaluative research method, and can only be gathered after a product has been released to assess its performance.

## Examples

Common forms of web analytics include:

- **General web analytics**: Analytics such as page views and traffic acquisition data are measured by tools like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).
- **Engagement data**: Engagement data reveals how deeply users are engaging with your design, and include analytics like time spent on a page and bounce rate.
- **Conversion data**: Conversion data focuses on key business goals, such as whether users click a "contact sales" or purchase button, download a white paper, or sign up for your newsletter.
- **Audience demographic data**: Data about who is using your website or app, for example, age and gender data, or data about which devices or browsers people tend to visit from.
- **[A/B testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/putting-ab-testing-in-its-place/)**: A/B testing presents two or more different versions of a design to users to test their effectiveness. [Multivariate testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/multivariate-testing/) is similar to A/B testing, but involves varying multiple design elements at the same time.
- **Heatmaps or clickmaps**: Heatmaps or clickmaps offer visual representations of how users are interacting with a design and where they are looking or clicking the most. Common heatmap tools include [CrazyEgg](https://crazyegg.com) and [Hotjar](https://hotjar.com).
