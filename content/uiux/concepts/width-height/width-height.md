Width and height are listed together like this: 500 x 600. The first value is width, the "x" is read as "by," and the second value is height.

[Design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software) displays the width (W) and height (H) of each layer. Units of measurement vary across design software, but pixels or points are commonly used to measure a layer’s dimensions. For more information, check out [Any Difference Between's article](​​https://anydifferencebetween.com/difference-between-pixel-and-point/) about pixels vs. points and [Material Design's resource about pixel density](https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html).
