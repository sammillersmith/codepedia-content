**Acquiescence bias** is the tendency to agree with the interviewer. In general, participants are more likely to agree than to disagree. Thus, the question should not imply that there is a "correct" answer. Instead of asking for agreement or disagreement with a predefined statement, researchers can ask users to explain their point of view.

## Example

_“Would you agree that you are satisfied with the current interface?”_ This question nudges the user to agree and could lead to acquiescence bias.

_“How do you feel about the current interface?”_ This phrasing is open-ended and does not lead participants toward a particular sentiment.
