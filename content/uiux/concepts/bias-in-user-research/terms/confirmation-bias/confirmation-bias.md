**Confirmation bias** is the tendency for researchers to interpret data in a way that supports their opinions and beliefs. Researchers know the study’s goal, so they might make connections that aren’t explicit in the data set based on their opinions, beliefs, or expectations.

## Example

This survey asked, “Which of the following emotions do you feel when at the airport? Please select the options below.”

The team’s larger goal is to make a product that boosts positive feelings at the airport. Confirmation bias might mean looking at this data and only reporting findings based on the statistic “57.1 of our participants are excited when traveling at the airport.” While this is true, there is no direct link between their product causing the positive response.
