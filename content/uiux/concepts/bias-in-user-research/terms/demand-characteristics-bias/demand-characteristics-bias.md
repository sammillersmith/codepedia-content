**Demand characteristics bias** changes how a user answers questions due to knowledge about the research study. If the user knows, or thinks they know, the study's objective, it could influence their responses and behaviors.

## Examples

A researcher runs a concept test to evaluate an early design idea. The participant may believe that the goal is to validate the idea so the company can move on to the development phase. This belief could influence them to try to “help” the researcher. They might provide positive feedback even if they don’t like the idea.

A coffee company is trying to research if their coffee tastes better as a cold brew. If the participants know the intent of the study they might favor the cold brew over hot brew even if the hot brew tastes better.
