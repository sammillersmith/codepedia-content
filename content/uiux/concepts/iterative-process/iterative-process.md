The **iterative process** refers to the creative exercise of producing different versions or variations of a possible solution.

An example of the iterative process would be [sketching](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching) multiple wireframes for a [homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/homepage) that features different elements and layouts. From afar, these iterations could all serve as possible solutions to the layout of a homepage. By iterating to find a solution, the goal is to narrow down what solutions work best. Design iteration can be used after research, testing, and feedback as a method to improve designs based on newfound information.
