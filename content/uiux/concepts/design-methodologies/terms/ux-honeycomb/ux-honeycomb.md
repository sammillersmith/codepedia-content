The **UX Honeycomb** diagram, created by designer and information architect [Peter Morville](https://semanticstudios.com/about/), defines "good" UX design as useful, usable, desirable, findable, accessible, credible, and valuable.

The UX Honeycomb, [according to Morville](https://semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/), is intended to take the conversation about what defines good design beyond usability and make some of the trade-offs made during a given design process more explicit.

The terms included in the UX Honeycomb can be defined as follows:

- **Useful**: Fulfills a user's needs.
- **Usable**: Easy to use and understand.
- **Desirable**: Visually attractive and succinct.
- **Findable**: easy to navigate and find information.
- **Accessible**: Users with disabilities can use the product.
- **Credible**: The product, company, and services are trustworthy.
- **Valuable**: Delivers business value.

The distinction between descriptors like these is helpful when assessing a product or design. For example, a usable and desirable design may not be useful, or answer a user's needs.
