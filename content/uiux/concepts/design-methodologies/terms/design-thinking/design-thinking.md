**Design thinking** is a [design methodology](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-methodologies) that puts people at the center of every process and encourages designers to set aside assumptions. This formal methodology has [developed across multiple disciplines since the 1960s](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-thinking-get-a-quick-overview-of-the-history) and is commonly associated with the design and consulting firm [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com/) and the Stanford School of Design (the [d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/)).

## The Five Phases of Design Thinking

Design thinking's core activities are ideation, inspiration, and implementation, which occur across the five stages of the process:

1. **Empathize**: Understand the user and the landscape.
2. **Define**: Define the problem and align with business goals and user needs.
3. **Ideate**: Generate a range of ideas for possible solutions, emphasizing creativity.
4. **Prototype**: Explore potential solutions by creating prototypes of the product to gather feedback.
5. **Test**: Test the best solutions developed during prototyping.

Prototyping or testing may lead to redefining the problem altogether. As with the other processes we've covered, this is an iterative cycle.

## About Design Thinking

Like the [double diamond model](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-methodologies/double-diamond-diagram), design thinking offers opportunities to focus on both [divergent thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/divergent-thinking) and [convergent thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/convergent-thinking) across its steps to encourage both creativity and problem solving.

Design thinking isn't limited to creating new products &mdash; it can affect change at a systemic level. The term "[wicked problems](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wicked-problems)" was coined by design theorist Horst Rittel to describe the types of extremely complex, multi-dimensional problems that designers are often tasked to solve.

Design thinking is said to live at the intersection of desirability (people), viability (business), and feasibility (technology).
