The **`useRef()`** hook in React is used to create mutable references to elements or values within functional [components](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/components). It enables direct access and interaction with DOM elements, allowing the persistence of data across renders without triggering re-renders.

## Syntax

In the `useRef()` hook, the `initialValue` is an optional parameter that can be provided when creating a new ref object.

`initialValue` allows the initialization of the `.current` property of the ref object with an initial value.

This hook can be utilized as follows :

```pseudo
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
```

When `useRef()` is called, it returns a ref object, and this ref object has a `.current` property.

If no `initialValue` is provided, `myRef.current` will be null by default.

## Example 1

In this example, the `useRef()` hook is used to store the previous value of the count state, allowing the display of the current and previous count values without triggering re-renders.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function PreviousValue() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const prevCountRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    prevCountRef.current = count;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Previous Count: {prevCountRef.current}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the code example, useRef is used to create the `prevCountRef` reference to store and access the previous value of the count state variable.

To store the previous count value in a state variable (using `useState()`), each time the `Increment` button is clicked and the count changes, it would trigger a re-render. Because changing state variables causes components to re-render.

There is no need to re-render the component just to track the previous value; it's only necessary to update the value without causing a re-render. So the `useRef()` hook is used.
