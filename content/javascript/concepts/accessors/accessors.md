In JavaScript, object properties can be obtained using **accessors**. Properties are established and retrieved with methods known as "getters" and "setters".

The `get` keyword is used to define a getter method for establishing a custom behavior when accessing the values of object properties, while the `set` keyword is used to create a setter method that determines the behavior when assigning values to those properties.

## Syntax

There are two ways to access properties: dot notation and bracket notation.

```pseudo
const object = {
    get propertyName() {}
}

object.propertyName
object[propertyName]
```

## Example

The following example defines a `User` class with a constructor and a getter method. It demonstrates how to encapsulate and access the email information of a user using accessor methods.

```js
class User {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this._name = name;
    this._email = email;
  }

  get userEmail() {
    return this._email;
  }
}

const person = new User('eddy', 'eddythefreedy9876@gmail.com');
console.log(person.userEmail);
```

This example results in the following output:

```shell
eddythefreedy9876@gmail.com
```
