A `DataFrame` is the primary object used by the Pandas module to store and manipulate data. It is a structured collection of data arranged in rows and columns, similar to a database table.

Many Pandas functions, such as [`.read_csv()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/pandas/built-in-functions/read-csv), return `DataFrame` objects. Other functions take `DataFrame` objects and accept them as parameters. In addition, most of Pandas' functionality is implemented through the `DataFrame` object. Methods and properties of the `DataFrame` object are listed below.
